Analysis and Control of a 2D quadrotor system

In this quadrotor system we analysed Controllability
and estimation of the system and compare with the results for real
world. We find optimal ways to control the quadrotor system for
balancing at differnet thrusts and torques during the course of its
motion. Also, we analysed linear system model of this quadrotor
at its equillibrium point. Moreover, we devised the non-linear
system model for this system to analyze its controllibility and
stability. We implemented Linear Quadratic Regulation and
Kalman filter model to this linear system.
